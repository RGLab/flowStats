NEW UTILITIES

o Added an argument 'plot' to lymphGate() to produce plots of results.

o Added an argument 'bwFac' to warpSet() to allow finer control to the
  smoothing of the density kernal estimation (in curv1Filter). This bandwidth
  factor would affect the number of landmarks. 

o Added two arguments 'refLine1' and refLine2' to quandrantGate() allowing
  algorithm to ignore minor, yet significant, sub-populations below 'refLine1'
  and 'refLine' when calculating the separator between positive and negative.
